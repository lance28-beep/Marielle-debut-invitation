  narrative: `Our story began in 2016, when a quiet admiration led him to reach me through his friend in the Rotaract Club,a simple gesture that laid the first brick of something meaningful.  Over the course of a year of patient and sincere courtship, we chose each other despite our opposite personalities and the challenges of a long-distance relationship, we discovered a love that didn't happen by chance but was built with intention, step by step, layer by layer.

What began as a simple hello eventually turned into a journey of trust, growth, and steadfast devotion. A relationship tested by load, strengthened by trials, and grounded in faith, proving that the best structures are those built on solid foundations. Along the way, we learned that God wasn't just guiding our hearts. He was overseeing every detail like the ultimate Project Manager. He taught us patience in the waiting, strength in the distance, and grace in every season.

In the grand blueprint of our story, this isn't the final chapter. This is the moment when the foundation is complete, the plans are approved, and we finally get to build the life we've only imagined. And if there's one thing we know for sure, it's that with God leading the project, this love is designed not just to stand but to last.`,
